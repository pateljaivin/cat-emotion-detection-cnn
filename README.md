In our work we Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was trained with a total of 21 layers. This architecture included 5 convolutional layers, 5 max pooling layers, 5 normalization layers, 1 flatten layer, 3 dense layers, and 2 dropout layers. The model was trained using a dataset of 200 images per class, with a total of 800 images. It provides very good performance at a relatively low computational cost.

Unfortunately, no cat emotion detection dataset is available publicly for this task. I have decided to create a dataset containing four different emotions. the images can be collected from different search engine and cat breed detection image dataset which is available on Kaggle. Those images are categorised into 4 different categories: angry, fear, happy, and relaxed. The aim is to construct a dataset with around 800 images of cats containing approximately 200 images of each emotion.

here i attach attached the smaple images of the dataset
